# Security Policy and Vulnerability Disclosure

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Links, please report it responsibly.

### What to Report

We're interested in vulnerabilities including but not limited to:
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization issues
- SQL injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Sensitive data exposure
- URL validation bypass
- Rate limit bypass
- API abuse vectors

### How to Report

**Email**: mike@mikeodnis.dev

**Include in your report**:
1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce (detailed)
3. Proof of concept (if applicable)
4. Potential impact assessment
5. Suggested fix (if available)
6. Your contact information

**Encryption**: PGP key available on request

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 5-7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

### Our Commitment

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report
- Keep you informed of our progress
- Credit you for the discovery (if desired)
- Work with you to understand the issue
- Notify you when the issue is fixed

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against 
security researchers who:

1. **Act in Good Faith**
   - Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations
   - Avoid data destruction or degradation
   - Don't access data beyond what's necessary
   - Don't exploit the vulnerability beyond demonstration

2. **Report Promptly**
   - Notify us as soon as possible
   - Provide reasonable time for fixes
   - Don't publicly disclose before resolution

3. **Follow Responsible Disclosure**
   - Don't demand compensation
   - Coordinate public disclosure with us
   - Respect our disclosure timeline

## Out of Scope

The following are generally **not** considered vulnerabilities:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Attacks requiring physical access
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
- Spam or social engineering
- Reports from automated tools without validation
- Missing security headers without demonstrated impact
- Cookie issues without security impact
- Clickjacking on pages without sensitive actions
- Open redirects without demonstrated security impact
- URL validation on user-generated content
- Rate limiting bypass on non-critical endpoints
- Information disclosure (version numbers, etc.) without exploitation path

## Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However:
- We greatly appreciate security research
- We will publicly acknowledge researchers (with permission)
- Severe vulnerabilities may receive discretionary rewards
- Hall of fame recognition on our security page

## Security Best Practices

When testing:
- **Use test accounts only** - Don't use real user data
- **Don't perform load testing** - This disrupts service
- **Limit your testing scope** - Stay within links.mikeodnis.dev
- **Don't social engineer** - Focus on technical vulnerabilities
- **Respect privacy** - Don't access other users' data
